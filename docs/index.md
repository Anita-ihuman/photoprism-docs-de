## For the early birds ##

Step-by-step installation instructions can be found in [Getting Started](getting-started/index.md) - 
all you need is a Web browser and Docker to run the server. It is available for Mac, Linux and Windows.

Next, you'll have to [index or import](user-guide/library/import-vs-index.md) 
existing files. Please be patient, this will take a while depending on the size of your library.

Already indexed photos can be browsed in [Photos](user-guide/organize/browse.md) 
while videos show up in [Videos](user-guide/organize/video.md).
Counts are continuously updated in the navigation.

If photos are missing, they might be in [review](user-guide/organize/review.md) due to low quality or missing metadata.
You can turn this and other features off in [Settings](user-guide/settings/ui.md), depending on
your specific use case.

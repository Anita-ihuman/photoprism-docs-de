# Funding

This project is about freedom and privacy but not necessarily about free beer. We feel like it
would be a mistake to state there will be no costs, because clearly we have huge expenses, your server hardware
will have a price tag and then maybe you'd like to have some extra features that need to be developed.

It's fair to say that users with basic needs will have no monthly costs. We were also way more effective 
per dollar than commercial projects and learned a lot on top of it.
An earlier version of this document contained a rough number, but at the end of the day it doesn't matter.

Most established OSS companies make the bulk of their revenue with enterprise customers, that's why private users 
and single developers typically get everything for free. Obviously that doesn't work if you have only private users
that refuse to share their data on top of it.

Looking forward, specific solutions for funding development and maintenance could be to...

  - sell a tested & supported version in the app store while our contributors and other developers can 
    continue to use Docker or build from source
  - provide additional features to users who support us financially, maybe with a different license similar to GitLab
  - develop a one-click solution for private cloud hosting together with selected providers we trust
  - offer a geodata, public events and maps subscription since OpenStreetMap doesn't want us to use their development 
    API for production, which is perfectly fine

# Review non-photographic and low-quality images #
When adding new photos a quality score from 1 to 5 is created automatically.
Photos with a quality score lower than 3 do not appear in *Photos* until you approve them (unless the quality filter was disabled
in [*Settings*](../settings/ui.md))

The quality score depends on the following:

* At least 2 MP resolution if taken after 2012
* Photo not classified as info or screenshot
* Photo is favorite, was edited or approved

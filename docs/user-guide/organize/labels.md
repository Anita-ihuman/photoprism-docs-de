# Labels #
PhotoPrism uses labels to classify images.
Other tools use the term tags instead of labels.
Labels are set automatically when adding new photos. 
You can manually add new labels or edit/remove the ones that have been created by us.

In *Labels* you find all labels of your photos and videos. 
You can star labels by clicking :material-star:. Stared labels will be listed first.

To see only labels with high priority click :material-eye: in the upper right corner.

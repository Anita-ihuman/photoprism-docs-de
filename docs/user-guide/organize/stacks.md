## Grouped Files ##

In case you have "Grouped Sequentials" enabled in [*Settings*](../settings/ui.md) you might have photos that consist of more than one JPEG file.
Grouped files are displayed in *Stacks*.

!!! info
    Files are grouped in two cases:
    
    1. Filenames are related: 'IMG_1234 (2)' or 'IMG_1234 copy 2' are assumed to belong to the same photo.
    2. Photos that have been taken at the same location AND in the same second.

### Browse through related files ###

1. Click on *sequence*

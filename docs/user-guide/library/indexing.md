# Indexing your originals #

!!! info
    If you're using PhotoPrism for the first time, make sure your photo and video 
    collection is properly configured as *originals* folder.
    See installation instructions in [Getting Started](../../getting-started/index.md) for details.
    When starting with an empty folder, you need to add or upload files first.


1. Go to *Library* using the main navigation

2. Select a sub-folder or keep the default to index all files

3. Select *Complete Rescan* to re-index all originals, including already indexed and unchanged files

4. Press *Start* to start indexing

!!! tip
    You may use [WebDAV](webdav.md) for adding files to the *originals* folder.
    This is especially helpful if PhotoPrism is running on a remote server.

!!! tip 
    A NSFW detector can be enabled to automatically flag pictures as private which 
    may have offensive content. Note that this is only somewhat reliable. 

#### When should "Complete Rescan" be selected? ####

If selected, all files in the *originals* folder will be re-indexed, including already indexed and unchanged files. 
This may be necessary after upgrading, especially to new major versions.

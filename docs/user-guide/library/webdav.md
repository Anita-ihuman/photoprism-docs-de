# Add files using WebDAV #
In case you have PhotoPrism running on a server you can use WebDAV to add files to your *import* or *originals* folder.


Just follow those [instructions](../backup/webdav.md).

Once all files are added you can start [importing or indexing](import-vs-index.md) your files.

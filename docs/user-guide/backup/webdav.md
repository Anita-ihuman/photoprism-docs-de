# Connect via WebDAV #

WebDAV clients, like Microsoftâ€™s Windows Explorer or Apple's Finder, can connect directly 
to PhotoPrism. 
This mounts the *originals folder* as a network drive and allows you to open, edit, and delete 
files from your computer or smartphone as if they were local.

The originals folder URL for public servers is:

```
https://admin@example.com/originals/
```

Please replace *example.com* with your actual domain. 
The slash at the end is important and cannot be omitted. 

When connecting, you'll have to authenticate using your regular password.
It will also change when you update it in *Settings*. The user name is `admin`.

!!! info
    You can also connect to the import folder by replacing `originals/` with `import/` in the URL.

For users, who are running PhotoPrism locally on the default port *2342*, the *originals* folder URL is:

```
http://admin@localhost:2342/originals/
```

!!! attention
    Never use WebDAV **without https** outside your local, private network as your
    password would be transmitted, in clear text, over the Internet.

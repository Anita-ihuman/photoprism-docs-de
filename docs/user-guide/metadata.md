PhotoPrisms intention is to give you the full power over your photos and videos as well as all the metadata you add to it.
We want you to be able at any time to export all metadata you enter in PhotoPrism. 

In case you decide to choose another solution for your photos in the near or far future -  all the work you put into your photo collection (like adding title, labels, locations etc.) will be available for you in standard formats.

PhotoPrism automatically provides you with a json and a yml file containing all relevant data.
You find those in your `originals` within the `.photoprism` folders.
